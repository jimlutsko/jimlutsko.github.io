In brief ...
=============

My background is in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and nowadays most of my time is spent on the study of crystallization and crystal growth. Previously, I have worked on non-classical diffusion, granular materials, symbolic learning, kinetic theory and the mechanical properties of solid interfaces. My work involves a combination of analytic theory, numerical analysis and computer simulation. My work is currently funded by the European Space Agency, via the Belgian Science Policy Office, and the EU Horizon 2020 program, via the [AMECRYS project](http://www.amecrys-project.eu). 

Crystallization and crystal growth
==================================

Crystallization is a particularly complex example of the of more general phenomenon of nucleation: the fluctuation-driven transition from one metastable state to another, usually more stable, state via the formation of clusters. Small clusters are unstable and tend to dissipate but if, by chance, one grows sufficiently large it is thermodynamically driven to continue to grow and fluctuations are no longer necessary. Thus, crystal nucleation and crystal growth are two parts of the process of creating crystals. 

My Opensource Project
======================
My work makes extensive use of classical Density Functional Theory. The codes I have developed for doing cDFT calculations, including crystallization, are available for download from [this link](https://jimlutsko.github.io/classicalDFT).
