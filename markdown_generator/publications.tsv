Van Driessche	Mineral Growth beyond the Limits of Impurity Poisoning	Crystal Growth and Design	18	171	2018	Lutsko_CGD_2017.pdf	More often than not, minerals formed in nature are grown at low supersaturation and from sources that are impure with respect to the crystals’ main building blocks. Quite paradoxically, these conditions are in conflict with the established crystal growth theories that focus on the interplay between the crystal interface and impurities that are present in the growth medium. These theories predict a kinetic dead zone for the cases where low purity is combined with weak driving forces. Hints toward reconciling this apparent disparity have been given by the observation that a specific class of steps, socalled macrosteps, can circumvent the debilitating kinetic effects of impurities in ways that up until now are poorly understood. In this contribution, we examine the mechanism of crystal growth by means of kinetic Monte Carlo simulation at conditions close to impurity-induced kinetic arrest. In agreement with previous reports, we show that as a result of impurity binding to the crystal surface, steps spontaneously group into bunches and later condense into macrosteps. A kinetic analysis demonstrates that these macrosteps are able to evade crystal growth cessation under conditions where single steps are firmly pinned. We identify the mechanism of interstep cooperativity which leads to cessation evasion by macrosteps and demonstrate that it applies to a range of supersaturation and impurity concentration values. On the basis of these findings, we present a model that explains how minerals can grow from mother liquor solutions that would otherwise seem to be nonconducive to crystal growth.

Lutsko	Lattice induced crystallization of nanodroplets: the role of finite-size effects and substrate properties in controlling polymorphism	Nanoscale	10	4921	2018	Lam_Lutsko_Nanoscale_2018.pdf	Targeting specific technological applications requires the control of nanoparticle properties, especially the crystalline polymorph. Freezing a nanodroplet deposited on a solid substrate leads to the formation of crystalline structures. We study the inherent mechanisms underlying this general phenomenon by means of molecular dynamics simulations. Our work shows that different crystal structures can be selected by finely tuning the solid substrate lattice parameter. Indeed, while for our system, face-centered cubic is usually the most preponderant structure, the growth of two distinct polymorphs, hexagonal centered packing and body-centered cubic, was also observed even when the solid substrate was face-centered cubic. Finally, we also demonstrated that the growth of hexagonal centered packing is conditioned by the appearance of large enough body-centered cubic clusters thus suggesting the presence of a cross-nucleation pathway. Our results provide insights into the impact of nanoscale effects and solid substrate properties towards the growth of polymorphic nanomaterials.

Duran-Olivencia, Peter Yatsyshin, Serafim Kalliadasis, and Jim Lutsko	General framework for nonclassical nucleation	New Journal of Physics	20	83019	2018	Lutsko_2018_3.pdf	A great deal of experimental evidence suggests that a wide spectrum of phase transitions occur in a multistage manner via the appearance and subsequen transformation of intermediate metastable states. Such multistage mechanisms cannot be explained within the realm of the classical nucleation framework. Hence, there is a strong need to develop new theoretical tools to explain the occurrence and nature of these ubiquitous intermediate phases. Here we outline a unified and self-consistent theoretical framework to describe both classical and nonclassical nucleation. Our framework provides a detailed explanation of the whole multistage nucleation pathway showing in particular that the pathway involves a single energy barrier and it passes through a dense phase, starting from a low-density initial phase, before reaching the final stable state. Moreover, we demonstrate that the kinetics of matter inside subcritical clusters favours the formation of nucleation clusters with an intermediate density, i.e. nucleation precursors. Remarkably, these nucleation precursors are not associated with a local minimum of the thermodynamic potential, as commonly assumed in previous phenomenological approaches. On the contrary, we find that they emerge due to the competition between thermodynamics and kinetics.
107	James F. Lutsko	Classical density functional theory, unconstrained crystallization, and polymorphic behavior	Phys. Rev. E	98	12604	2018	Lutsko_PRE_2018.pdf	While in principle, classical density functional theory (cDFT) should be a powerful tool for the study of crystallization, in practice this has not so far been the case. Progress has been hampered by technical problems which have plagued the study of the crystalline systems using the most sophisticated fundamental measure theory models. In this paper, the reasons for the difficulties are examined and it is proposed that the tensor functionals currently favored are in fact numerically unstable. By reverting to an older, more heuristic model it is shown that all of the technical difficulties are eliminated. Application to a Lennard-Jones fluid results in a demonstration of power of cDFT to describe crystallization in a highly inhomogeneous system. First, we show that droplets attached to a slightly hydrophobic wall crystallize spontaneously upon being quenched. The resulting crystallites are clearly faceted structures and are predominantly HCP structures. In contrast, droplets in a fully periodic calculational cell remain stable to lower temperatures and eventually show the same spontaneous localization of the density into “atoms” but in an amorphous structure having many of the structural characteristics of a glass. A small change of the protocol leads, at the same temperature, to the formation of crystals, this time with the fcc structure typical of bulk Lennard-Jones solids. The fcc crystals have lower free energy than the amorphous structures which in turn are more stable than the liquid droplets. It is demonstrated that as the temperature israised, the free energy differences between the structures decrease until the solid clusters become less stable thanthe liquid droplets and spontaneously melt. The presence of energy barriers separating the various structures is therefore clearly demonstrated.
106	James F. Lutsko	Systematically extending classical nucleation theory	New Journal of Physics	20	103015	2018	Lutsko_2018_5.pdf	The foundation for any discussion of first-order phse transitions is Classical Nucleation The- ory(CNT). CNT, developed in the first half of the twentieth century, is based on a number of heuristically plausible assumtptions and the majority of theoretical work on nucleation is devoted to refining or extending these ideas. Ideally, one would like to derive CNT from a more fundamen- tal description of nucleation so that its extension, development and refinement could be developed systematically. In this paper, such a development is described based on a previously established (Lutsko, JCP 136:034509, 2012 ) connection between Classical Nucleation Theory and fluctuating hydrodynamics. Here, this connection is described without the need for artificial assumtions such as spherical symmetry. The results are illustrated by application to CNT with moving clusters (a long-standing problem in the literature) and the constructrion of CNT for ellipsoidal clusters.

Lutsko	Solvent-mediated interactions between nanostructures: From water to Lennard-Jones liquid	J. of Chemical Physics	149	134703	2018	Lutsko_2018_6.pdf	Solvent-mediated interactions emerge from complex mechanisms that depend on the solute structure, its wetting properties, and the nature of the liquid. While numerous studies have focused on the first two influences, here, we compare the results from water and Lennard-Jones liquid in order to reveal to what extent solvent-mediated interactions are universal with respect to the nature of the liquid. Besides the influence of the liquid, the results were obtained with classical density functional theory and brute-force molecular dynamics simulations which allow us to contrast these two numerical techniques.
104	Jean Pierre Boon and James F. Lutsko	Temporal diffusion: From microscopic dynamics to generalised Fokker-Planck and fractional equations	J. Statistical Physics	166	1441	2017	Boon_Lutsko_2017.pdf	The temporal Fokker–Planck equation (Boon et al. in J Stat Phys 3/4: 527, 2003) or propagation–dispersion equation was derived to describe diffusive processes with temporal dispersion rather than spatial dispersion as in classical diffusion. We present two generalizations of the temporal Fokker–Planck equation for the first passage distribution function f j(r, t) of a particle moving on a substrate with time delays τ j . Both generalizations follow from the first visit recurrence relation. In the first case, the time delays depend on the local concentration, that is the time delay probability Pj is a functional of the particle distribution function and we show that when the functional dependence is of the power law type, Pj ∝ f ν−1 j , the generalized Fokker–Planck equation exhibits a structure similar to that of the nonlinear spatial diffusion equation where the roles of space and time are reversed. In the second case, we consider the situation where the time delays are distributed according to a power law, Pj ∝ τ −1−α j (with 0 <α< 2), in which case we obtain a fractional propagationdispersion equation which is the temporal analog of the fractional spatial diffusion equation (with space and time interchanged). The analysis shows how certain microscopic mechanisms can lead to non-Gaussian distributions and non-classical scaling exponents.

Lutsko	Solute particle near a nanopore: influence of size and surface properties on the solvent-mediated forces	Nanoscale	9	17099	2017	Lam_Lutsko_Nanoscale_2017.pdf	Nanoscopic pores are used in various systems to attract nanoparticles. In general the behaviour is a result of two types of interactions: the material specific affinity and the solvent-mediated influence also called the depletion force. The latter is more universal but also much more complex to understand since it requires modeling both the nanoparticle and the solvent. Here, we employed classical density functional theory to determine the forces acting on a nanoparticle near a nanoscopic pore as a function of its hydrophobicity and its size. A simple capillary model is constructed to predict those depletion forces for various surface properties. For a nanoscopic pore, complexity arises from both the specific geometry and the fact that hydrophobic pores are not necessarily filled with liquid. Taking all of these effects into account and including electrostatic effects, we establish a phase diagram describing the entrance and the rejection of the nanoparticle from the pore.

Lett.	116	15501	2016	Lutsko_PRL_2016.pdf	Crystals grow by laying down new layers of material which can either correspond in size to the height of one unit cell (elementary steps) or multiple unit cells (macrosteps). Surprisingly, experiments have shown that macrosteps can grow under conditions of low supersaturation and high impurity density such that elementary step growth is completely arrested. We use atomistic simulations to show that this is due to two effects: the fact that the additional layers bias fluctuations in the position of the bottom layer towards growth and by a transition, as step height increases, from a 2D to a 3D nucleation mechanism.
101	James F. Lutsko 	Mechanism for the stabilization of protein clusters above the solubility curve: The role of non-ideal chemical reactions	J. Phys. Cond. Matt.	28	244020	2016	Lutsko_JPCM_2015_1.pdf	Dense protein clusters are known to play an important role in nucleation of protein crystals from dilute solutions. While these have generally been thought to be formed from a metastable phase, the observation of similar, if not identical, clusters above the critical point for the dilute-solution/strong-solution phase transition has thrown this into doubt. Furthermore, the observed clusters are stable for relatively long times. Because protein aggregation plays a central role in some pathologies, understanding the nature of such clusters is an important problem. One mechanism for the stabilization of such structures was proposed by Pan, Vekilov and Lubchenko and was investigated using a dynamical density functional theory model which confirmed the viability of the model. Here, we revisit that model and incorporate additional physics in the form of state-dependent reaction rates. We show by a combination of numerical results and general arguments that the state-dependent rates disrupt the stability mechanism. Finally, we argue that the state-dependent reactions correct unphysical aspects of the model with ideal (state-independent) reactions and that this necessarily leads to the failure of the proposed mechanism.
100	James F. Lutsko and Grégoire Nicolis	Mechanism for the stabilization of protein clusters above the solubility curve	Soft Matter	12	93	2016	Lutsko_SoftMatter_2016.pdf	Pan, Vekilov and Lubchenko [J. Phys. Chem. B, 2010, 114, 7620] have proposed that dense stable protein clusters appearing in weak protein solutions above the solubility curve are composed of protein oligomers. The hypothesis is that a weak solution of oligomer species is unstable with respect to condensation causing the formation of dense, oligomer-rich droplets which are stabilized against growth by the monomer–oligomer reaction. Here, we show that such a combination of processes can be understood using a simple capillary model yielding analytic expressions for the cluster properties which can be model and show that it is consistent with the predictions of the capillary model. The viability of the used to interpret experimental data. We also construct a microscopic Dynamic Density Functional Theory mechanism is thus confirmed and it is shown how the radius of the stable clusters is related to physically www.rsc.org/softmatter interesting quantities such as the monomer–oligomer rate constants.
99	James F. Lutsko and Miguel A. Durán-Olivencia	A Two-parameter Extension of Classical Nucleation Theory	J. Phys. Cond. Matt.	27	235101	2015	Lutsko_JPCM_2015_1.pdf	A two-variable stochastic model for diffusion-limited nucleation is developed using a formalism derived from fluctuating hydrodynamics. The model is a direct generalization of the standard Classical Nucleation Theory. The nucleation rate and pathway are calculated in the weak-noise approximation and are shown to be in good agreement with direct numerical simulations for the weak-solution/strong-solution transition in globular proteins. We find that Classical Nucleation Theory underestimates the time needed for the formation of a critical cluster by two orders of magnitude and that this discrepancy is due to the more complex dynamics of the two variable model and not, as often is assumed, a result of errors in the estimation of the free energy barrier.
98	Miguel A. Durán-Olivencia and James F. Lutsko	Mesoscopic nucleation theory for confined systems: A one-parameter model.	Phys. Rev. E	91	22402	2015	Lutsko_PRE_2015.pdf	Classical nucleation theory has been recently reformulated based on fluctuating hydrodynamics [J.F. Lutsko and M.A. Durán-Olivencia, J. Chem. Phys. 138, 244908(2013)]. The present work extends this effort to the case of nucleation in confined systems such as small pores and vesicles. The finite available mass imposes a maximal supercritical cluster size and prohibits nucleation altogether if the system is too small. We quantity the effect of system size on the nuceation rate. We also discuss the effect of relaxing the capillary-model assumption of zero interfacial width resulting in significant changes in the nucleation barrier and nucleation rate.
97	Mike Sleutel, James F. Lutsko, Dominique Maes, and Alexander E. S. Van Driessche	Mesoscopic impurities expose a nucleation-limited regime of crystal growth	Phys. Rev. Lett.	114	245501	2015	Lutsko_PRL_2015_1.pdf	Nanoscale self-assembly is naturally subject to impediments at the nanoscale. The recently developed ability to follow processes at the molecular level forces us to resolve older, coarse-grained concepts in terms of their molecular mechanisms. In this Letter, we highlight one such example. We present evidence based on experimental and simulation data that one of the cornerstones of crystal growth theory, the CabreraVermilyea model of step advancement in the presence of impurities, is based on incomplete physics. We demonstrate that the piercing of an impurity fence by elementary steps is not solely determined by the Gibbs-Thomson effect, as assumed by Cabrera-Vermilyea. Our data show that for conditions leading up to growth cessation, step retardation is dominated by the formation of critically sized fluctuations. The growth recovery of steps is counter to what is typically assumed, not instantaneous. Our observations on mesoscopic impurities for lysozyme expose a nucleation-dominated regime of growth that has not been hitherto considered, where the system alternates between zero and near-pure velocity. The time spent by the system in arrest is the nucleation induction time required for the step to amass a supercritical fluctuation that pierces the impurity fence.
