Abstract
---
The growth of crystals from solution is a fundamental process of relevance to such diverse areas as X-ray-diffraction structural determination and the role of mineralization in living organisms. A key factor determining the dynamics of crystallization is the effect of impurities on step growth. For over fifty years, all discussions of impurity-step interaction have been framed in the context of the Cabrera--Vermilyea (CV) model for step blocking, which has nevertheless proven difficult to validate experimentally. Here we report on extensive computer simulations which clearly falsify the CV model, suggesting a more complex picture. While reducing to the CV result in certain limits, our approach is more widely applicable, encompassing non-trivial impurity-crystal interactions, mobile impurities and negative growth, among others.
