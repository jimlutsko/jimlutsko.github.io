Abstract
---
The planar surface tension of coexisting liquid and vapor phases of a fluid of Lennard-Jones atoms is studied as a function of the range of the potential using both Monte Carlo simulations and Density Functional Theory. The interaction range is varied from rc* = 2.5 to rc* = 6 and the surface tension is determined for temperatures ranging from T* = 0.7 up to the critical temperature in each case. The results are shown to be consistent with previous studies. The simulation data are well-described by Guggenheim&apos;s law of corresponding states but the agreement of the theoretical results depends on the quality of the bulk equation of state.
