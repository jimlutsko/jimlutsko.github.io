Abstract
---
Impurities control the formation of bio-crystals and can fully paralyze crystal growth at low levels of supersat­
uration. Traditional impurity models predict that an escape from this so-called “dead zone” requires an increase
in the driving force (i.e. supersaturation). In this work, using protein crystals as a model system, we uncover an
alternative escape route from the dead zone that does not involve an increase in supersaturation. We demonstrate
that the merger of a protein cluster with the crystal surface triggers the formation of an ordered multi-layered
island. The newly created surface on top of the resulting 3D island is initially devoid of impurities and there­
fore characterized by near-pure step growth kinetics. The accelerated step advancement on this relatively un­
contaminated surface limits the available time for impurities to adsorb on the emerging terraces and by extension
their resulting surface density. Cluster-mediated crystal growth occurring in heterogeneous media can therefore
lead to stop-and-go dynamics, which offers a new model to explain crystallization taking place under biological
control (e.g. biomineralization).
