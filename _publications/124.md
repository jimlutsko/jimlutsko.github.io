Abstract
---
We use classical density functional theory (cDFT) to calculate fluid-solid surface tensions for fcc and bcc
crystals formed by hard spheres and Lennard-Jones (LJ) particles. For hard spheres, our results show that
the recently introduced “explicitly stable” functionals perform as well as the state of the art, and for both
interaction potentials, our results compare well to simulation. We use the resulting bulk and interfacial
energies for LJ to parametrize a capillary model for the free energy of small solid clusters and thereby
determine the relative stability of bcc and fcc LJ clusters. We show a crossover from bcc to fcc stability as
cluster size increases, thus providing insight into long-standing tension between simulation results and
theoretical expectations. We also confirm that the bcc phase in contact with a vapor is unstable, thus
extending earlier zero-temperature results. Our Letter demonstrates the potential of cDFT as an important
tool in understanding crystallization and polymorphism.
