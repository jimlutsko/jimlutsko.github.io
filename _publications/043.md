Abstract
---
A model for the pair-distribution function of nonequilibrium hard-core fluids is proposed based on a model for the effect of velocity correlations on the structure. Good agreement is found with molecular dynamics simulations of granular fluids and of sheared elastic hard spheres. It is argued that the incorporation of velocity correlations are crucial to correctly modeling atomic scale structure in nonequilibrium fluids.
