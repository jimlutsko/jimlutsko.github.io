Abstract
---
The basic advantages of the density functional theory over the other statistical mechanical theories of freezing are outlined. The feasibility of a density functional based calculation is illustrated m *.he case of the hard sphere freezing. The difficulties encountered in the extension of the.se results to continuous potentials are discussed and a possible solution is presented.
