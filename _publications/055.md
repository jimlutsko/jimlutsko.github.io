Abstract
---
Thermodynamic perturbation theory is applied to the model of globular proteins studied by ten Wolde and Frenkel [P. R. ten Wolde and D. Frenkel Science 77, 1975 (1997)] using computer simulation. It is found that the reported phase diagrams are accurately reproduced. The calculations show how the phase diagram can be tuned as a function of the length scale of the potential.
