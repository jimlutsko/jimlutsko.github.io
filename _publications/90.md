Abstract
---
In a recent paper [ Phys. Rev. E 86 040102(R) (2012)], Santos presented a self-consistency condition that can be used to limit the possible forms of fundamental measure theory. Here, the direct correlation function, resulting from the Santos functional, is derived, and it is found to be very close to the result of the White Bear density functional, except near the origin where it diverges.
