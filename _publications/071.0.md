Abstract
---
Many recent papers have questioned Irving and Kirkwood’s atomistic expression for stress. In Irving and Kirkwood’s approach both interatomic forces and atomic velocities contribute to stress. It is the velocity-dependent part that has been disputed. To help clarify this situation we investigate (i) a fluid in a gravitational field and (ii) a steadily rotating solid. For both problems we choose conditions where the two stress contributions, potential and kinetic, are significant. The analytic force-balance solutions of both these problems agree very well with a smooth-particle interpretation of the atomistic Irving-Kirkwood stress tensor.
