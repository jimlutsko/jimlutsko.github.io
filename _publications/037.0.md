Abstract
---
A moment method is used to solve the Enskog equation for the steady-state distribution under conditions of uniform shear flow. Comparison to nonequilibrium molecular dynamics demonstrates that the lowest order solution gives a good quantitative description of nonlinear effects such as shear thinning and normal stresses in a moderately dense fluid. The results are used as a basis in the formulation of a simple and quantitatively accurate kinetic model of the Enskog equation.
