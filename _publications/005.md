Abstract
---
A simple fluid in uniform isothermal shear flow is studied for conditions used in recent nonequilibrium computer simulations. The short-time dynamics for the local conserved densities is found to be unstable at large shear rates for wave vectors near the peak of the structure factor. The critical shear rates obtained are similar to those for an order-disorder transition observed in the computer simulations.
