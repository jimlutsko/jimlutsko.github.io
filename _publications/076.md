Abstract
---
The Density Functional approach to equilibrium statistical mechanics is reviewed. Topics covered include the basic theory behind Density Functional Theory, exact density functionals in low dimension, and theories based on effective liquid approximations. Particular attention is given to more recent developments such as Fundamental Measure Theory for hard-spheres, Dynamical Density Functional Theory and the determination of state transition pathways.
