Abstract
---
Three different results for the nonanalytic dependence of the shear viscosity on shear rate have been given. This discrepancy is resolved by an independent calculation based on the nonlinear Navier-Stokes-Langevin equations. The relationship to previous calculations and reasons for the differences are described.
